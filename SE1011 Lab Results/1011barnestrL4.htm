/*
This program is a game where a user chooses between two scenarios where their uncle offers them money.
Until he dies (0-40 weeks) he will either add an original value of money between $0-5000 per week or
double money every week starting at $0.01.
If the option chosen is greater than the opposite option, the user wins and the user is shown how much extra money they made.
If the option chosen is less than the opposite option, the user loses and the user is shown how much money they missed out on.
Finally, the user is given the option to play again or end the program.
