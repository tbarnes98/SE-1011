# Lab 2: Keeping Our Sources Straight
## Objectives
- Translate UML class diagrams into source code
- Construct software which uses class inheritance
- Employ method Overriding in the development of software
- Use the super keyword to execute constructors in a superclass
- Use the java.util.ArrayList collection class to hold class data

## Introduction
When writing a research paper, it is very important to keep your sources straight. You will discover this in your GS-1002 course, where you will learn about formal research papers. You will also use this skill later on in your academic career here at MSOE.

BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references, and is very commonly used in engineering research papers at the graduate level. The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system, allowing one to easily manage bibliography entries and a formal paper. BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner, by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information.

For example, we might use a book as a reference. An appropriate book entry is that which is shown below. Note that the syntax for this format is very important, so pay attention to all the commas, braces, quotes, etcâ€¦
```
@BOOK { SE1021Text,
author = "John Dean and Raymond Dean", 
title = "Introduction to Programming with Java",
publisher = "McGraw Hill",
year = "2014"
}
```
An article, published in a magazine, might be referenced in the format shown below.
```
@ARTICLE { WSMA2006,
author = "Walter Schilling and Dr. Mansoor Alam", 
title = "Integrate static analysis into a software development process",
journal = "Embedded Systems Design",
pages = "67-72",
year = "2006"
}
```

Note that the unique identifiers in these two examples (SE1021Text and WSMA2006) were hand chosen. For your code, you will create them in an automated way where the first is REF0, then REF1, then REF2, and so on (see sample output below).

In this lab, you are going to create a system which will allow the user to enter the fields for a given set of references and then be able to print out the bibtex entries for the entered references. You will be provided with a Main class, but are responsible for developing all other code for this project. [Javadoc updated 12/3/17](http://msoe.us/taylor/se1021/lab2doc/index.html) is available for each method. Be sure to read the complete Javadoc cafefully to ensure that your implementation of each method meets the specifications provided in the Javadoc. Note that when you update a reference, you can assume that the user will need to update the entire entry, not just the one component of the entry.
